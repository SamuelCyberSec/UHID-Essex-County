# Urban Heat Island Dashboard for Essex County, New Jersey

This repository hosts the full workflow, analysis modules, and documentation for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) Dashboard developed as part of a graduate thesis project at Montclair State University. The work integrates remote sensing, geospatial analytics, socioeconomic indicators, traffic intensity, and machine learning to identify heat hotspots and evaluate intervention strategies across Essex County, NJ.

## Objectives

- Extract and map Land Surface Temperature (LST) using Landsat 8/9.
- Analyze UHI drivers including land cover, vegetation, imperviousness, and traffic.
- Integrate socioeconomic vulnerability using ACS Census data.
- Build a machine learning model to detect UHI hotspots.
- Simulate cooling interventions (e.g., tree planting, cool roofs, reflective pavement).
- Develop an interactive geospatial dashboard for data-driven decision-making.
- Provide transparent, reproducible documentation for academic and municipal use.
